![Smart City: Automobile toxic emission monitoring remotely](/Smart_City.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")

The sole idea of this project is to achieve full automation of the Pollution Under Control (PUC) system  which will help to keep a coherent track on a vehicleâ€™s exhaust emission.

##The Arduino Code
The code required for communicating with the HCP is here
- [Arduino.ino](./Arduino.ino)
