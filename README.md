Smart City Project: Monitoring Vehicle Toxic Emission Remotely 

![Smart City: Automobile toxic emission monitoring remotely](/Smart_City.jpg?raw=true )

The sole idea of this project is to achieve full automation of the Pollution Under Control (PUC) system  which will help to keep a coherent track on a vehicleâ€™s exhaust emission.

##The Arduino Code
The code required for communicating with the HCP is here
- [Arduino.ino](./Arduino.ino)

## Brief Description of the project

The sole purpose of the project is to monitor the toxic emission of the motor vehicle in real time. Here are some of the benifits of the project

- No need to stand in long queues and fix dates for PUC certificates
- only 7-8% of the vehicles on the road emits the pollutants above permissible level. So why pay for PUC certification
- The certification is provided by measuring the toxic gases once every six months, while the proposed system continously renders the toxic emission and push the data to the IoT servers
- No hidden cost: One time installation cost 
- The system can even installed within the current OBD port availabe at the Dashbord of recently mmanufactured motor vehicles
- Just pullout your smartphone and show the real time toxic emission data to the Traffic Officer
